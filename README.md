## Xamarin.Android.HMSLocation

**Introduction**
HUAWEI Location Kit combines the GPS, Wi-Fi, and base station locations to help you quickly obtain precise user locations, build up global positioning capabilities, and reach a wide range of users around the globe.Currently, it provides the four main capabilities: fused location, location semantics, activity identification, and geofence. You can call relevant capabilities as needed.

### Setup

-   Available on NuGet:  [[https://www.nuget.org/packages/Xamarin.Android.HMSLocation/](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Xamarin.Android.HMSLocation/))] [![NuGet](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/8a3005d7f8ce0d50737ec134a48480ad61bfa5b9/68747470733a2f2f696d672e736869656c64732e696f2f6e756765742f762f506c7567696e2e4669726562617365507573684e6f74696669636174696f6e2e7376673f6c6162656c3d4e75476574)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Xamarin.Android.HMSPushKit/)
-   Install into your .NETStandard project and Client projects.
-   Please make sure you have  Xamarin.Android.HMSBase as a refernance

**Platform Support**
Xamarin.Android

## Features

-   Fused location: Provides a set of simple and easy-to-use APIs for you to quickly obtain the device location based on the GPS, Wi-Fi, and base station location data.
    
-   Location semantics: Allows you to modify the location update request API to obtain both the location and address information based on the reverse geocoding capability.  
    
-   Activity identification: Identifies user motion status through the acceleration sensor, cellular network information, and magnetometer, helping you adjust your app based on user behavior.
    
-   Geofence: Allows you to set an interested area through an API so that your app can receive a notification when a specified action (such as leaving, entering, or lingering in the area) occurs.
